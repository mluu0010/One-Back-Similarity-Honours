			        Thank you for your interest in our study.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are interested in your experience of colour, more specifically, your experience of the relationships between different colours. 
				You will see circles of various colours presented one after another, and then we will ask you to rate the colour similarity of the most 
				recently presented circle with the circle that preceded it. After completing the trials, you will then fill out a short questionnaire. 
			</p>

			<p>This experiment will take approximately 2.5 hours of your time. Don't worry! Further instructions will be provided before the experiment starts, and you will get several practice trials.</p>

			<p>All data will be kept confidential. If you have any question at this stage, please contact the investigators above.</p>
