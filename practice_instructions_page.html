			<h1>Practice Round</h1>
			<p>You are going to familiarise yourself with this experiment in <emp>10</emp> practice trials.</p>
			<p>Instructions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Two coloured circles will be briefly flashed onto the screen in sequence. 
					<div class="instruct_fig">
						<img class="img-small" src="./fixation.png" border = "1">
						<img class="img-small" src="./practice_instructions_circle1.png" border = "1">
						<img class="img-small" src="./fixation.png" border = "1">
						<img class="img-small" src="./practice_instructions_circle2.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					A response screen will then appear where you will be asked to rate the similarity between the colours of the two circles from a scale of 0 = most similar to 7 = most dissimilar. 
					<div class="instruct_fig">
						<img class="img-small" src="./response_screen.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					You will then be given feedback based on your rating. This feedback will only be given in the practice trials. 
					<div class="instruct_fig">
						<img class="img-small" src="./practice_feedback.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					After the feedback, the colour of the middle square will change into the colour that belonged to the circle presented most recently. You will need to remember this colour for the next trial.
					<div class="instruct_fig"><img class="img-small" src="./practice_response_circle2.png" border = "1"></div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Upon clicking the middle square, another coloured circle will be briefly flashed. 
					<div class="instruct_fig"> 
						<img class="img-small" src="./fixation.png" border = "1">
						<img class="img-small" src="./practice_instructions_circle3.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Another response screen will appear where you will be asked to rate the colour of the most recently presented circle (Green) against the colour of the circle from the previous trial (i.e., the colour of the middle square) that you were asked to remember (Pink).
					<div class="instruct_fig">
					<img class="img-small" src="./response_screen.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Steps 3 - 6 will then be repeated for the remaining trials. 
				</li>
