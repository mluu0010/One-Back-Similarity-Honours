# Are Colour Experiences The Same Across The Visual Field?  
  
  
Project in progress. Run 'main.iqx' to run the experiment.  

Main parameters are controlled in 'main.iqx' in the \<values\> object.
 * 'stimulus_size' sets the radius of the central stimulus
 * 'peripheral_scale' sets the magnification factor for peripherally presented stimuli relative to centrally presented stimuli
 * 'radius_central' sets the radius at which central stimuli are presented in degrees of visual angle (DVA)
 * 'radius_peripheral' sets the radius at which peripheral stimuli are presented in DVA
