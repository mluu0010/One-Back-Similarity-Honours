			<h1>Good work!</h1>
			<p>Now we'll start the actual experiment. There are two blocks in this task. Each block consists of 162 trials.</p>
			<p>For your reference, here are the instructions again.  </p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Two coloured circles will be briefly flashed onto the screen in sequence. 
					<div class="instruct_fig">
						<img class="img-small" src="./fixation.png" border = "1">
						<img class="img-small" src="./practice_instructions_circle1.png" border = "1">
						<img class="img-small" src="./fixation.png" border = "1">
						<img class="img-small" src="./practice_instructions_circle2.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					A response screen will then appear where you will be asked to rate the similarity between the colours of the two circles from a scale of 0 = most similar to 7 = most dissimilar (Upon choosing a rating, you will not receive feedback as in the practice trials).
					<div class="instruct_fig">
						<img class="img-small" src="./response_screen.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you have clicked on a rating, the colour of the center square will change into the colour that belonged to the circle presented most recently. You will need to remember this colour for the next trial.
					<div class="instruct_fig"><img class="img-small" src="./practice_response_circle2.png" border = "1"></div>
				</li>
				<li>
					After clicking the middle square, another coloured circle will be briefly flashed. 
					<div class="instruct_fig" border = "1"> 
						<img class="img-small" src="./fixation.png" border = "1">
						<img class="img-small" src="./practice_instructions_circle3.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Another response screen will appear where you will be asked to rate the colour of the most recently presented circle (Green) against the colour of the circle from the previous trial (i.e., the colour of the middle square) that you were asked to remember (Pink).
					<div class="instruct_fig" border = "1">
					<img class="img-small" src="./response_screen.png" border = "1">
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Steps 3 - 5 will then be repeated for the remaining trials. 
				</li>
